%%
\item{\begin{bf}Container database\end{bf}} - ``Container Database (CDB) : On 
the surface this seems very similar to a conventional Oracle database, as it 
contains most of the working parts you will be already familiar with 
(controlfiles, datafiles, undo, tempfiles, redo logs etc.). It also houses 
the data dictionary for those objects that are owned by the root container 
and those that are visible to all PDBs.''\footnote{Multitenant : Overview of Container Databases (CDB) and Pluggable Databases (PDB)\\

\item{\begin{bf}Pluggable database\end{bf}} - ``Pluggable Database (PDB) : Since 
the CDB contains most of the working parts for the database, the PDB only n
eeds to contain information specific to itself. It does not need to worry about 
controlfiles, redo logs and undo etc. Instead it is just made up of datafiles 
and tempfiles to handle it's own objects. This includes it's own data dictionary, 
containing information about only those objects that are specific to the PDB. 
From Oracle 12.2 onward a PDB can, and should, have a local undo tablespace.''\footnote{Ibid.}
