+++ pandoc the general markup converter can be used 
    to convert the latex file (*.tex) to word documenent (docx):

    $ pandoc oracle.tex -o oracle.docx

    Works well with a few minor issues:
    o Black headers are changed to blue or grey color
    o Loose page breaks
    o Loose page numbers
    o Loose THEVERSION and THEBUILD since I've been targeting
      the undated oracloe.tex file.

    Pandoc: Markdown to PDF without page numbers
    Great page definitely a bit more understanding needed of tex to docx.
